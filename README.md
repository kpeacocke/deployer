A Go-based GitHub release deployer with blue/green deployment, designed to run on Raspberry Pi and launch Python apps using Poetry.

> 🚀 **Automatic releases**: Every push to main automatically creates a new release using semantic versioning!

## Features

- Polls GitHub for latest release
- Uses separate Poetry venvs for blue and green slots
- Atomic symlink switching
- Optional post-deploy hook
- Startup-safe with systemd
- Structured logging and monitoring
- Health checks and rollback support

## Installation

### Quick Install Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Install latest version to /usr/local/bin
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpeacocke/deployer/main/install.sh | bash

# Install specific version
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpeacocke/deployer/main/install.sh | bash -s v1.0.0

# Install to custom location
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpeacocke/deployer/main/install.sh | bash -s latest /opt/bin
```

```

### GitHub Packages

The project is also published as a GitHub Package with pre-built binaries:

```bash
# View package details
# https://github.com/kpeacocke/deployer/pkgs/npm/gh-deployer
```

> 📦 **Go Module**: Available on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kpeacocke/deployer) with full documentation  
> 📦 **GitHub Package**: Published to GitHub Packages with every release

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kpeacocke/deployer.git
cd deployer
make build
```

## Quick Start

1. **Get the binary** (see installation options above)

2. **Configure the deployer:**
   Edit `config.yaml` with your repository and deployment settings:
   ```yaml
   repo: "your-user/your-repo"
   asset_suffix: ".tar.gz"
   github_token: "your-github-token"  # or set GITHUB_TOKEN env var
   install_dir: "/opt/myapp/deployments"
   current_symlink: "/opt/myapp/current"
   ```

3. **Test with dry run:**
   ```bash
   ./gh-deployer --dry-run
   ```

4. **Install and run as systemd service:**
   ```bash
   make install
   make systemd-service
   sudo cp gh-deployer.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl enable gh-deployer
   sudo systemctl start gh-deployer
   ```

## Development

### VS Code Setup (Recommended)

For the best development experience, open this project as a workspace:

```bash
# Clone and open as workspace (optimal extension management)
git clone https://github.com/kpeacocke/deployer.git
code deployer/gh-deployer.code-workspace
```

This workspace configuration:
- ✅ **Enables only Go-relevant extensions** (golang.go, YAML, Markdown, Git tools)
- ✅ **Disables language features** for Python, Ansible, Docker, TypeScript, etc.
- ✅ **Optimizes performance** (disabled minimap, telemetry, file watching exclusions)
- ✅ **Provides consistent setup** for all contributors

> **Note**: If you have many extensions installed globally (Ansible, Godot, Python, etc.), you may need to manually disable them for this workspace. See `.vscode/README.md` for details.

### Build Commands

- **Run tests:** `make test`
- **Test with coverage:** `make test-coverage`
- **Format code:** `make fmt`
- **Lint code:** `make lint`
- **All checks:** `make check`

## Configuration

See `config.yaml` for all configuration options. Key settings:

- `repo`: GitHub repository to monitor (format: "owner/repo")
- `asset_suffix`: Filter releases by asset name suffix (e.g., ".tar.gz")
- `check_interval_seconds`: How often to check for new releases (default: 300)
- `install_dir`: Root directory for blue/green deployments
- `current_symlink`: Symlink pointing to active deployment
- `post_deploy_script`: Script to run after successful deployment

## Architecture

The deployer implements a blue/green deployment strategy:
- Two deployment slots (`blue` and `green`) with separate Poetry virtual environments
- Atomic symlink switching for zero-downtime deployments
- State persistence in `state.yaml`
- Rollback capability to previous version
- Health checks before activation

For detailed architecture information, see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Automatic Releases 🚀

This project uses **automatic semantic versioning** - every push to `main` triggers a release if there are new features or fixes!

### Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic version bumping:

- `feat:` - New feature → **Minor version** (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- `fix:` - Bug fix → **Patch version** (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1) 
- `perf:` - Performance improvement → **Patch version**
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` - Breaking change → **Major version** (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add health check endpoint"     # → 1.1.0
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak"            # → 1.0.1  
git commit -m "feat!: redesign configuration API"   # → 2.0.0
```

Every successful commit to main automatically:
- ✅ Runs full test suite and linting
- 🏷️ Creates a new semantic version tag
- 📦 Builds binaries for all platforms
- 🚀 Publishes GitHub release with assets
- 📖 Updates CHANGELOG.md automatically

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Use conventional commits: `git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Open a Pull Request

Your changes will be automatically released when merged to main!
